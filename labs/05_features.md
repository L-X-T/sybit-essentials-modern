## Work with folders instead of modules

In this exercise you will refactor your solution so that the parts belonging to the `flight-booking` feature will be moved to a subfolder:

1. Create an empty folder `flight-booking` into _src/app_.

2. Use your IDE to move the `FlightSearchComponent` (folder with name `flight-search`) into the newly created `flight-booking` folder.

3. Your IDE should have updated all import paths automatically. You might have to reserve your application.

4. Test your solution.
